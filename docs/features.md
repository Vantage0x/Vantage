# Feature Breakdown

Vantage offers a comprehensive suite of features designed to give Solana developers complete control over their memecoin launches. This guide provides detailed explanations of each feature, how they work, and when to use them.

## üéØ Core Features

### ü•∑ Stealth Deploy Technology

**What it does**: Allows you to prepare your entire token launch configuration without any blockchain activity, keeping your plans completely private until you're ready to execute.

**How it works**:
- All configuration stored locally in your browser
- No network requests or blockchain transactions during preparation
- Instant deployment when you choose to go live
- Zero visibility to bots or competitors until launch

**Use Cases**:
- **Coordinated Community Launches**: Prepare everything in advance, announce timing to community
- **Market Timing**: Wait for optimal market conditions before deploying
- **Competitive Advantage**: Launch before competitors can react
- **Error Prevention**: Test and refine configurations without cost

**Example Workflow**:
```
1. Configure token metadata (name, symbol, image, description)
2. Set up supply distribution across wallets
3. Configure sniper protection settings
4. Review and test configuration
5. Wait for optimal launch timing
6. Execute instant deployment
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚ö° **Instant Launch**: Sub-10-second deployment time
- üîí **Complete Privacy**: No public visibility during preparation
- üéØ **Perfect Timing**: Launch exactly when you want
- üí∞ **Cost Efficient**: No failed transactions during testing

### üõ°Ô∏è Advanced Sniper Protection

**What it does**: Intelligently detects and blocks automated bot purchases during your token's critical launch window, ensuring fair distribution to real users.

**How it works**:
- **Real-time Analysis**: Monitors all incoming transactions
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies bot-like behavior patterns
- **Automatic Blocking**: Prevents suspicious transactions from executing
- **Configurable Duration**: Protection active for 30-120 seconds after launch

**Protection Methods**:

#### 1. **Transaction Pattern Analysis**
```javascript
// Detected bot patterns:
- Identical transaction amounts
- Rapid-fire transactions from same wallet
- MEV (Maximum Extractable Value) patterns
- Known bot wallet addresses
```

#### 2. **Timing-Based Protection**
```javascript
// Protection rules:
- Block transactions in first 30-60 seconds
- Gradual release of protection over time
- Whitelist for verified community members
- Emergency stop functionality
```

#### 3. **Amount-Based Limits**
```javascript
// Transaction limits during protection:
- Maximum tokens per transaction
- Maximum tokens per wallet
- Minimum time between transactions
- Progressive limits (stricter early, looser later)
```



**Use Cases**:
- **Fair Community Launches**: Ensure real community members get tokens
- **Anti-MEV Protection**: Block sophisticated extraction bots
- **Price Stability**: Prevent immediate pump-and-dump schemes
- **Organic Growth**: Allow natural price discovery
