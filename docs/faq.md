## üöÄ Usage & Features

### What is "Stealth Deploy"?

Stealth Deploy allows you to configure your entire token launch (metadata, settings, distribution) without any blockchain activity. This keeps your plans completely private until you choose to execute the launch, preventing bots from front-running your deployment.

### How does sniper protection work?

Vantage's sniper protection uses multiple methods:
- **Pattern Analysis**: Detects bot-like transaction patterns
- **Timing Protection**: Blocks transactions for 30-120 seconds after launch
- **Amount Limits**: Restricts maximum tokens per transaction
- **Blacklist Integration**: Blocks known bot wallet addresses

### Can I launch multiple tokens simultaneously?

Yes! Vantage supports:
- **Batch Configuration**: Prepare multiple launches in stealth mode
- **Sequential Launching**: Launch tokens with delays between them
- **Portfolio Management**: Track multiple token projects

### What happens if my launch fails?

Vantage's **Instant Relaunch** feature saves your complete configuration. If a launch fails, you can:
1. Analyze what went wrong
2. Modify settings if needed
3. Relaunch with one click
4. All within 30 seconds

### How do I distribute tokens across multiple wallets?

1. Enable "Multi-Wallet Distribution" in launch settings
2. Add up to 5 wallet addresses
3. Set percentage distribution for each wallet
4. Vantage automatically handles the distribution during launch

All data is stored **locally in your browser**:

Vantage supports most popular Solana wallets:
- ‚úÖ **Phantom** (Recommended)
- ‚úÖ **Solflare**
- ‚úÖ **Backpack**
- ‚úÖ **Glow**

### What happens if I lose my browser data?

If you clear browser data or reinstall Chrome:
